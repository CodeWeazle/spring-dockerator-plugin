## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Enhanced Logging in Action
When running the plugin, users now see:
```
🚀 Spring Dockerator Plugin v0.0.6-SNAPSHOT
🔍 Detected project: my-app (1.0.0)
📦 Processing volume configuration...
✓ Configured volume: ../ssl -> /opt/ssl
🏗️  Generating service: my-app
📝 Created docker-compose.yml at: /path/to/project/docker/docker-compose.yml
✅ Docker Compose generation completed successfully!
```

### Volume Configuration Solution
Users should use this format:
```xml
<volumes>
  <volume>
    <external>../ssl</external>
    <internal>/opt/ssl</internal>
  </volume>
</volumes>
```
