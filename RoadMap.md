# spring-dockerator-plugin roadmap

To make this plugin more flexible, for the future these enhancements are planned.

- add testing framework
- create .env files for different environments (i.e maven-profiles).
- add support for a .dockerator file in the project. This can be used to describe additional features, such as volume mappings, networks etc.   
- add support for volumes and networks definitions
